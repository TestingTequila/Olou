OOPs Concepts:

1. Encapsulation
    -Data Hiding


2. Polymorphism
    -method overloading
    -method overriding

3. Inheritance
    -abstraction
    -interface

    ===================================================
    Poly(many)+morphism(forms): Methods with same name that exists in many forms
    In java, we can have 2 or more methods with the same name provided that their signature is different
      how to make signature different
       a) by changing the data types of the parameters
       b) by changing the order of parameters
       c) by changing the count of parameters

       Method overloading says, in a class we can have two or more methods with the same name
       provided their signature is different.

              Real Time Example of method overloading
              search/login/payment

              Can we overload main method: Yes
              And on running class with overloaded main method, JVM will always call default main



              Method overloading is also known as Compile Time Polymorphism
              Method overloading happens in the same class only
