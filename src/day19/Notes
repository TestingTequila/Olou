Variables: Variables are like boxes/jars/containers that can hold some values
How to create variables:
  1. when you the exact value that you want to store
     dataType nameOfVariable=value;
  2. when you don't know the exact value that you want to store

  What are data types:
  -->Primitive Data Types
       a) We know in advance how much memory this will consume
       b) We don't need objects to be able to use them
       Ex: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

  -->Non-Primitive Data Types
       a) We don't know in advance how much memory this will consume
       b) We need objects to be able to use them
       Ex: Array, Class, Strings........


       Whenever we are given an integer number to store
       1. Are you going to do some mathematical operation using the number
           Yes ----> choose int as data type
           No
             Check in which data types range the number exists
                if the number exists in all the data types
                   pick the data type which takes least memory
                else
                   use the data type in which this number belongs to
