Statements: These are used to make decisions

1. if else statement [To make single Decision]

     if(condition)
     {
         this code will execute if condition is true
     }
     else
     {
         this code will execute if condition is false
     }

2. if else if statement [This is used to make multiple decisions]
   if(condition1)
   {
     this code will execute if condition1 is true
   }
   else if(condition2)
   {
     this code will execute if condition2 is true
   }
   else if(condition3)
   {
     this code will execute if condition3 is true
   }
   .
   .
   .
   else if(conditionN)
   {
        this code will execute if conditionN is true
   }
   else
   {
      This will execute if none of the above condition is true
   }
3. switch statement: This is also used to make multiple decisions but this is relatively faster that if else if statement
