accessModifier returnType methodName(can/t parameters)
{
   action over class variables
}

accessModifier: This just defines the accessibility of a method
                 public: all classes can access it
                 private: only the class holding method can access it

Global/class level Variable: Variables which are inside the class and outside the method
                             When we create global?
                               -When you want your variable to be shared by multiple other methods
                                of the same class

Parameters: These are created within the () brackets of a method
            When we create methods with parameters ?
            When you don't want to share the value of a variable with multiple other methods, you pass it as parameters


Local Variables: These are created within the {} brackets of a method
                  while creating them, its mandatory to assign value to them
                  When do we create local variables?
